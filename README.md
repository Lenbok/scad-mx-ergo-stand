## Customizable MX Ergo stand.

This is a modified version of the Logitech MX Ergo Stand by darknao, that allows adjustable tilt and origin angle of tilt (which allows some forward tilt, which I find more comfortable).

When cloning, you need to make sure you get the submodules, e.g.:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Lenbok/scad-mx-ergo-stand.git
